                            <p style="text-indent: 25px">Backgammon is the oldest game in the world. It takes a lot of abstract thinking and psychological strategy. It's not for the easily frustrated.

                            <p style="text-indent:25px;">Classic series of fantasy video games from Nintendo. The most recent two are fully open-world games that have changed the face of the AAA quality video game industry.

                    <li style=color:brown;>Black tea</li>
                        <p style="text-indent:25px;">Strong and boldly flavored tea steeped at the highest temperature. Fully oxidized. Good in the morning because the balance is toward higher caffeine content. Should only be steeped once.

                    <li style=color:green;>Green tea</li>
                        <p style="text-indent:25px">Milder, vegetal-tasting tea steeped at a relatively low temperature. Minimally oxidized. Good in the afternoon because the balance is toward higher theanine content. Can be steeped 2, maybe 3 times.

                        <p style="text-indent:25px">Intermediate style of tea with oxidation ranging from around 10-90%. Boiled at different temperatures depending on oxidation, etc. Check the instructions or look it up for accurate steeping. Can be steeped several times; often said to be tastiest around the third steeping.

                <ol>
                    <li>Kayaking</li>
                        <p style="text-indent:25px">Action sport involving a small, maneuverable personal boat with a double-sided paddle. Most fun on a river with rapids and slower sections, as this makes for a varied trip with excitement and scenic relaxation. Also works on a lake.</p>
                    <li>Pool floats</li>
                        <p style="text-indent:25px">Inflatable boats that are fun to hang out on when it's sunny. Fun to spin around on. Watching birds, especially hawks, is a big bonus. Don't forget to bring a ball to throw, and maybe a beer, and Connect 4 or some other game that won't be destroyed by water. Eating watermelon on a float is a secret hack.</p>
                    <li>Taking a nice shower</li>
                        <p style="text-indent:25px">Light some candles, turn the lights off, and take a nice warm shower. It's good for your body and the low light is good for your eyes. A healthful daily relaxation technique.</p>
